# Application
- [ ] Ui / Ux
- [ ] Split material properties out
- [ ] Split camera controls out
- [ ] Split out light properties/controls
- [ ] Abstract state from DOM
- [ ] Modules globals/state
- [ ] Console controls
- [ ] Debugger logs

# Canvas
- [ ] Responsive

# Render Controls
- [ ] Fogging
- [ ] Shadows
- [ ] Anti aliasing / super-sampling
- [ ] Granularity

# Shading Controls
- [ ] Ui
- [ ] Switch between shading models
- [ ] Phong
- [ ] Flat/Smooth
- [ ] Ambient Occlusion

# Material Properties
- [ ] Ui
- [ ] Texture upload
- [ ] Texture mapping

# Camera Controls
- [ ] Ui
- [ ] Fix warping due to look at matrix
- [x] Virtual trackball movement for camera rotations
- [x] Trackball rotation about arbitrary axis
- [ ] User quarternian rotations to avoid Gimble lock
- [x] Project points outside of trackball on to the hemisphere
- [x] Fix bug when mouse drags to very edge of canvas
- [ ] Splines

# Light Properties
- [ ] Ui
- [ ] Point light creation
- [ ] Volumetric Lighting
- [ ] Look for bugs in phong shading
