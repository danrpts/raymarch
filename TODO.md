- [ ] Debugger logs

# Canvas
- [ ] Responsive

# Render Controls
- [ ] Fogging
- [ ] Shadows
- [ ] Anti aliasing / super-sampling
- [ ] Granularity

# Shading Controls
- [ ] ui
- [ ] Switch between shading models
- [ ] Phong
- [ ] Flat/Smooth
- [ ] Ambient Occlusion

# Material Properties
- [ ] Ui
- [ ] Texture upload
